Welcome to the Rebet Frontend Coding Challenge!

###


Please follow the step-by-step instructions below and upload your solution to a public github repo within 48 hours of receiving this. Email a link to connor@rebet.app.

In the same zip file in which you found this file, you will find a video titled "RebetP2PSliderDemo.mov". The crux of the challenge will be to recreate the component recorded there. 

The recorded P2P slider has the following properties of note (ordered in terms of importance):

    1. An "orb" that can be dragged left or right, and returns to center when released. 
    2. A track that defines the visibility and path of the orb. 
    3. A color scheme that changes when the orb is dragged left or right of center. 
    4. Animated bidirectional arrows and a glowing shadow. 
    5. Accept and decline indicators. 
    6. An action that is triggered when the orb is dragged completely to one side, and then released. 
    7. Various color gradients. 

Your goal is to recreate the UI/UX of the slider as closely as possible, using a Javascript framework of your choice. 
To complete the challenge, send an executable Javascript file(s) that I can run on my machine using "npm run/start". 
When I run the file, a web page with a centered slider should appear. Email any questions to connor@rebet.app.
